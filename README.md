# Digital Bookshelf

A categorized collection of PDF books for learning and reference. All books live under `bookshelf/` and are organized by topic.

## Structure

- **Root**: `bookshelf/` — every book or multi-file title is placed here.
- **Categories**: Each category is a subfolder (e.g. `bookshelf/Software Engineering/`).
- **Multi-file books**: Some titles are split into chapters or parts and live in their own subfolder inside the category (e.g. `bookshelf/Software Engineering/Chaos_Engineering/`).
